 Course Project Guidelines and Rubric
  
Group Project and Presentation Instructions 
This assignment implements data science issues related to Data Manipulation with Pandas, Scikit-Learn preprocessing of data, JSON File Manipulation, Web Scraping and Crawling, Multithreading, and optionally using the Django Framework.  Accordingly, the group is asked to clearly differentiate and understand their project topic's requirements. Please follow the instructions outlined below. 
Project Submission 
Submit your project using Moodle and include the GitHub repository link. 
Full run code and make a presentation (team members) in the lecture. 
Review the Project Rubric (scoring guide). 
Each group should propose before Mentioned above.
